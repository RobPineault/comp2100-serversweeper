# Server Sweeper

## Introduction
Server Sweeper is a modified version of the classic pc game / time waster known as MineSweeper. In the game, the player uses numerical deduction to deduce the location of bombs on a tile grid, utilizing definitive readouts that offer vague information on their own. Like unlocking a box, it’s a kind of puzzle that unwraps as the player progresses through.
